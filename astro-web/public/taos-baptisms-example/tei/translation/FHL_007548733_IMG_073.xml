				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>fifth day of the month of August of the year 1839</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on a six-day-old child. I named him <persName>José Rafael</persName>, natural son of <persName>Guadalupe Vigil</persName>, an Indian servant of the late <persName>José Vigil</persName>, resident of the town of <placeName>La Santísima Trinidad de Arroyo Seco</placeName>. His godparents were <persName>Francisco Tomás [Bentos?]</persName> and <persName>María Soledad Vigil</persName>, residents of the same place. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
