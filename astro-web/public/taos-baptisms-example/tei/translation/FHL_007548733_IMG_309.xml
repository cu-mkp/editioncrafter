				<p>This baptism was according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church with the catechism and approval already having taken place. The godparents were <persName>Nazario Aguilar</persName> and <persName>María de la Cruz Mascareñas</persName>, residents of the same place. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
