				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>tenth day of the month of December of one thousand eight hundred and forty-three</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on a child, one month old. I named him <persName>Juan Francisco</persName>, descendant of the Ute tribe from which he was rescued. He is a servant of <persName>Antonio Díaz Armenta</persName> and <persName>María Isabel Sánchez</persName>. His godparents were <persName>Juan Antonio Madrid</persName> and <persName>María Manuela Romero</persName>, all residents of the town of <placeName>Río Colorado</placeName>. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
