				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>twentieth day of the month of June of one thousand eight hundred and forty-six</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on a child, five years old. I named her <persName>María Rosalía</persName>, descendant of the Navajo tribe from which she was rescued. She is a servant of <persName>Francisco Salazar</persName> and <persName>María Manuela Vigil</persName>, residents of the town of <placeName>La Santísima Trinidad</placeName>. The godparents were <persName>Luciano Salazar</persName> and <persName>María de la Concepción Salazar</persName>, residents of the same place. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
