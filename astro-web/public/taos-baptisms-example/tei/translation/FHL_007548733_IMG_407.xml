				<head>{left margin} María Soledad</head>
				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>twenty-fourth day of the month of March of one thousand eight hundred and forty-five</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on a two-day-old child. I named her <persName>María Soledad</persName>. She is the natural daughter of <persName>María Guadalupe Bent</persName>, an Indian servant of <persName>Charles Bent</persName>, who had been rescued from the nations of the north. The godparents were <persName>Elfego Bent</persName> and <persName>María Romualda Luna</persName>, residents of the town of <placeName>Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</placeName>. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
