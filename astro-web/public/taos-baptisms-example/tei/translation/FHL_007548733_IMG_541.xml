				<head>{left margin} Juana María</head>
				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>twenty-first day of the month of June of one thousand eight-hundred and forty-six</date>: Having already carried out the corresponding catechisms until I certified her to be instructed in the principles, means, and ends of our holy religion, and having the pious affection of becoming a Christian and observing the precepts, I, priest <persName>Don Eulogio Valdez</persName>, with permission from the parish priest, solemnly exorcised, placed holy oils, baptized and anointed [her] with sacred chrism according to the rites of our Holy Church for the baptism of adults. I named her <persName>Juana María</persName>, a servant of <persName>Doña María Rafaela Varela</persName>, resident of this town of <placeName>Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</placeName>. The said adult is a descendant of the Ute tribe from which she was rescued. The godparents were <persName>Don Juan de Jesús Valdez</persName> and <persName>María Juliana Trujillo</persName>, residents of the same place. I advised them of their obligations and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
