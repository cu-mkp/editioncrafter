				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName>, on the <date>eleventh day of the month of January of one thousand eight hundred and forty-two</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, out of extreme necessity, having certified her by virtue of catechisms and assessed her intention and desire of becoming a Christian, solemnly exorcised, baptized, and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on an adult, sixteen years old. I named her <persName>Catarina</persName>. She is an Indian servant of <persName>Don Juan Manuel Lucero</persName>, resident of the town of <placeName>San Francisco de Paula</placeName>. He himself was the godparent, along with his wife <persName>Juana María Martínez</persName>. I advised them of their obligation that, as masters of said servant, and also as godparents, they had to give and take care of her education, to teach her Christian duties, and the spiritual kinship that they contracted. I signed it for the record.</p>
