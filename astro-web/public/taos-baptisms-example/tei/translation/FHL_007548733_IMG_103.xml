				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>twenty-third day of the month of March of the year one thousand eight hundred and forty</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, in urgent need due to illness, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on an adult woman, about twenty years of age, which I did according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church regarding the baptism of adults. Having previously started catechism, she was found moderately instructed in the principles, means, and ends of our holy religion, enough for her to be granted her request to become a Christian, in the condition that she was in. I named her <persName>María Soledad</persName>. She is a descendant of the Navajo tribe and a servant of Señora <persName>María Teodora Romero</persName>, who rescued her. The same Señora María Teodora Romero was her godmother, along with her son, <persName>Jorge Antonio</persName>, of the town of <placeName>San Fernando</placeName>. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship. I signed it for the record.</p>
