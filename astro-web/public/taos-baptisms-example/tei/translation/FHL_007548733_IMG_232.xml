				<p>In this parish of <placeName>Taos</placeName> on the <date>sixteenth day of the month of October of one thousand eight hundred and forty-two</date>: I, parish priest <persName>Don Antonio José Martínez</persName>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and sacred chrism on a one-day-old infant. I named her <persName>María Florentina</persName>, natural daughter of an Indian servant of Señora <persName>Ignacia Jaramillo</persName>, resident of the town of <placeName>Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</placeName>. The godparents were <persName>Francisco Jaramillo</persName> and <persName>María Romualda de Luna</persName>, residents of the same place. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</p>
