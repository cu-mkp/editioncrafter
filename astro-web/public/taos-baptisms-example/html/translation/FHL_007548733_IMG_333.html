I named her <tei-persname data-origname="persName">María Dolores</tei-persname>. She is an Indian of the Navajo tribe from which she was rescued. The steps of catechism were carried out and she was found well instructed in the principles, means, and ends of our holy religion. Desiring to be admitted to this practice through the holy sacrament of baptism, she recanted the errors and principles that she had acquired in her gentile sect, being completely willing and with the strongest resolution to live in observance of this Christian religion, which is conferred upon her in baptism. She is a servant of <tei-persname data-origname="persName">José del Espiritu Santo Córdoba</tei-persname>. Her godparents were <tei-persname data-origname="persName">José Dolores Durán</tei-persname> and <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Juana María de Gracia Sánchez</tei-persname>, all residents of <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">San Francisco del Rancho</tei-placename>. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship, and I signed it for the record.</tei-p>
