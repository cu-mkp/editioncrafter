				<tei-p data-origname="p">In this parish of <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">Taos</tei-placename> on the <tei-date data-origname="date">seventh day of the month of September of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine</tei-date>: I, parish priest <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Don Antonio José Martínez</tei-persname>, solemnly baptized and placed holy oils and chrism on an Indian child, seven or eight years old, who was rescued from the Ute tribe. Although it has been one year since he was rescued, he is still not sufficiently instructed, but being ill, and with the little that he has learned, he has effectively explained that he desires to join the religion of Jesus Christ. I verified that he is a servant of <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Don Charles Beaubien</tei-persname>, resident of <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">San Fernández</tei-placename>. His godparents were <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Eugenio [Letendosen?]</tei-persname> and <tei-persname data-origname="persName">María Rufina Vigil</tei-persname>, also from San Fernández. I advised them of their obligation and spiritual kinship. I signed it for the record. [^The name of the baptized child was <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Juan Manuel</tei-persname>]</tei-p>
