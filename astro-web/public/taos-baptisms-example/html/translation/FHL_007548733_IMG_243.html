I named her <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Catarina</tei-persname>. She is an Indian servant of <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Don Juan Manuel Lucero</tei-persname>, resident of the town of <tei-placename data-origname="placeName">San Francisco de Paula</tei-placename>. He himself was the godparent, along with his wife <tei-persname data-origname="persName">Juana María Martínez</tei-persname>. I advised them of their obligation that, as masters of said servant, and also as godparents, they had to give and take care of her education, to teach her Christian duties, and the spiritual kinship that they contracted. I signed it for the record.</tei-p>
