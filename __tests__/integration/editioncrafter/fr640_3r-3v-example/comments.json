Next take an ℥ of sal ammoniac, an ℥ of sulfur, the yellowest that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a [deleted: a pot] glass sublimatorium, hold this over a small fire for an hour & a slightly stronger one for an hour, & a very good fire for an hour, and it will be done. Next, to use it, apply soot black with the glue that painters use to paint, & two or three times, until it is quite black. Next apply a little varnish. Once dry, apply the purpurine <i>a secco</i> with a finger where you want. The more of it you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if you want, apply varnish on top."

It is struck through with diagonal lines and is separated from the subsequent text by a horizontal line. The second half of the page (now at the top), is in the author-practitioner's main hand (hand A). This suggests that he took a bound, mostly-blank book—perhaps a book recording accounts such as the ones found here—struck through the account records, and began to record medical recipes and a list of titles under them. Then, when he ran out of room, he flipped the entire book over, turned it upside down, and began writing on what now is the first folio of the manuscript (fol. 1r)."
