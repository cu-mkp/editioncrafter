				<p>This <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs> is for making large quantities of <rs ref="#rs-m">turpentine oil</rs>, that is to say a <rs ref="#rs-ms">bucket an </rs><rs ref="#rs-tmp">hour</rs>, and no matter which <rs ref="#rs-m">turpentine it may be, whether fine or crude</rs>. One needs to give, as you know, a little fire at the beginning and always keep <rs ref="#rs-m">cold water</rs> in the cooler on the top. The <rs ref="#rs-ms">lb</rs> is sold at xii <rs ref="#rs-cn">sous</rs>, &amp; at the bottom of the <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs> remains the <rs ref="#rs-m">colophony</rs>, or <rs ref="#rs-la">pix gr√¶ca</rs>.<note n="c_003v_01">Latin: "Greek pitch"</note> In this <rs ref="#rs-tl">vessel</rs>, <rs ref="#rs-m">eau-de-vie</rs> is also made well, and there is no need to distill it again. You do not need a <rs ref="#rs-tl">oven</rs> for this <rs ref="#rs-m">copper</rs> vessel, but only <rs ref="#rs-m">charcoal</rs> around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is round, you will place it on a <rs ref="#rs-tl">trivet</rs>.</p>
				<p rend="left-middle">It is better to heat the <rs ref="#rs-m">varnish</rs> a little bit, rather than to put it out <rs ref="#rs-env">in the sun</rs>, because this makes the panel <rs ref="#rs-po">warp</rs>.</p>
				<p rend="left-middle">Some say it is not good to distil in this <rs ref="#rs-m">copper</rs> vessel because it makes things green. However, when <rs ref="#rs-m">tinned</rs>, it is good.</p>

				<head>For varnishing</head>
				<p><rs ref="#rs-m">Turpentine varnish</rs> does not need any <rs ref="#rs-m">glue</rs> because it is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the <rs ref="#rs-m">wood</rs> like that of <rs ref="#rs-m">spike lavender</rs> &amp; <rs ref="#rs-m">sandarac</rs>. Also, that of <rs ref="#rs-m">spike lavender</rs> does not require any <rs ref="#rs-m">glue</rs> on <rs ref="#rs-m">iron</rs> &amp; similar things that do not absorb. But on <rs ref="#rs-m">wood</rs> &amp; on colors which <del>have</del> <add>do not have</add> <rs ref="#rs-m">gum</rs> or <rs ref="#rs-m">distemper glue</rs>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said <rs ref="#rs-m">hide glue</rs> &amp; to let it dry &amp; to varnish.</p>
