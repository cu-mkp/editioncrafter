<lb/>instead of fine turpentine. And you can put into two
<lb/>lb of &lt;-tou-&gt; common turpentine one lb
<lb/>of fine turpentine oil &amp; do everything as with the other one. This one
<lb/>will cost you no more than five or six sous per
<lb/>lb &amp; is sold for 40 sous per
<lb/>lb.

<lb/>This vessel is for making large quantities of
<lb/>turpentine oil, that is to say a bucket an
<lb/>hour, and no matter which turpentine it may be,
<lb/>whether fine or crude. One needs to give, as you know, a little
<lb/>fire at the beginning and always keep cold water in the cooler
<lb/>on the top. The lb is sold at xii sous, &amp;
<lb/>at the bottom of the vessel remains the colophony, or
<lb/>pix gr√¶ca. In this vessel, eau-de-vie is also made well,
<lb/>and there is no need to distill it again. You
<lb/>do not need a oven for this copper vessel, but
<lb/>only charcoal around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
<lb/>round, you will place it on a trivet.

<ab>
<lb/> It is better to heat the varnish a little bit, rather than to
<lb/>put it out in the sun, because this makes the panel
<lb/>warp.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/> Some say it is not good to distil in this copper
<lb/>vessel because it makes things green. However, when tinned, it is
<lb/>good.

<ab>
<lb/>For varnishing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it
<lb/>is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood like that
<lb/>of spike lavender &amp; sandarac. Also, that of spike
<lb/>lavender does not require any glue on iron &amp;
<lb/>similar things that do not absorb. But on wood &amp; on colors
<lb/>which &lt;-have-&gt; do not have gum or 
<lb/>distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<lb/>hide glue &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
<lb/>varnish.
