<lb/>Varnish of spike lavender oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>One needs to heat spike lavender oil &amp; as it begins to
<lb/>simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum so that it soon melts. And
<lb/>over a charcoal fire stir continuously until the sandarac
<lb/>is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<lb/>varnish on a plate, and if it is fatty when you handle
<lb/>it with a finger, it is ready. And for one lb
<lb/>of spike lavender oil, you will put five ounces of
<lb/>pulverized sandarac, although some only put in four
<lb/>ounces, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
<lb/>promptly dry. Frame makers, to avoid the trouble of polishing
<lb/>their ebony, varnish it with this, as do guitar makers.
<lb/>This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine,
<lb/>though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
<lb/>varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish was in use,
<lb/>because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<lb/>turpentine, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
<lb/>pulverized mastic extracted in tears or otherwise, &amp; it will be
<lb/>more desiccative, in place of sandarac.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>If you want to varnish on plaster or a wall, first put on
<lb/>your very hot hide glue, because if were cold it
<lb/>would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your
<lb/>varnish on, it would come off.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>Varnish of spike lavender oil is not as appropriate for colors as
<lb/>that of turpentine, for spike lavender oil &lt;-makes them
<lb/>die-&gt; eats the colors since it is too
<lb/>penetrating.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>For removing varnish from an old panel that is yellowish &amp;
<lb/>varnishing it anew
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>Take white soap &amp; sieved ashes&lt;-e-&gt;, &amp;
<lb/>soak both in water. And with a sponge, take the said
<lb/>ashes &amp; soap &amp; rub the panel with them. And as you
<lb/>see that the old varnish is removed, throw a
<lb/>bucket of water against the panel to clean it.
<lb/>Next put it for a quarter of an hour in the
<lb/>sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
<lb/>is dry, you can spread your turpentine varnish on it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>Make sure the colors do not come off.
