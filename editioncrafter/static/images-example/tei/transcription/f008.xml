<lb/>One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a
<lb/>bizarre thorn branch, then melt a lb of the most
<lb/>beautiful clear pitch resin and put in one ounce of
<lb/>subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if
<lb/>you add in a little Venice laque platte, the
<lb/>color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted
<lb/>over a charcoal fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 
<lb/>Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments
<lb/>should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the
<lb/>charcoal.
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>Colophony is nothing other than recooked resin. To do
<lb/>it well, take a leaded pot &amp; melt the resin,
<lb/>&amp; boil it over the brazier a good hour,
<lb/>&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like
<lb/>water, &amp; easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a
<lb/>stick with which you grind it, &amp; test it. Then pour it
<lb/>through a coarse canvas or a very light tammy
<lb/>cloth, such that when pouring it falls into the
<lb/>strongest vinegar that you can find, for the vinegar gives
<lb/>it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
<lb/>or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For
<lb/>counterfeiting your coral, you can mix a quarter part of
<lb/>mastic into your purified resin to render it more firm
<lb/>and more beautiful, &amp; if you were to take a single tear of
<lb/>mastic, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

<lb/>Sulfur &amp; vermilion makes the same effect.

<lb/>The coral made of gules red enamel endures the
<lb/>file and polishing.
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>It is made like cement that is stronger mixed with pestled
<lb/>&lt;-than of-&gt; glass rather than with brick. Thus, here one
<lb/>mixes well pestled gules red enamel, which
<lb/>is red in body, with the vermilion. Thus with all colors of
<lb/>enamels.

<lb/>Varnish for panels
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>Take a lb of Venice turpentine &amp; heat
<lb/>it in a pot until it simmers, and put in half a lb of
<lb/>the turpentine oil of the whitest you can find, and stir it
<lb/>together well on a charcoal fire and take it off immediately. And
<lb/>&lt;-elle-&gt; it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
<lb/>add in a little more oil. Similarly if it is too clear, you can
<lb/>thicken it by putting in a little turpentine. Thus you will give it
<lb/>whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
<lb/>heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
<lb/>and other painted things without corrupting the colors or yellowing. And
<lb/>it dries both in the shade and in the sun, and
<lb/>overnight, and during the winter as well as
<lb/>in the summer. It is commonly sold 15 sous a
<lb/>lb.
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>A little more turpentine than turpentine oil is needed in
<lb/>order to give body to the varnish, which needs to be applied with
<lb/>the finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
<lb/>for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
<lb/>varnish to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
<lb/>of them.
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>Thick varnish for planks
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>There is a varnish that takes a long time to dry &amp;
<lb/>drips more than two months after it has been applied to the
<lb/>planks. But this one does not drip like that of times
<lb/>past, which was made of linseed oil, garlic boiled in it
<lb/>to extinguish it &amp; rid it of grease, 
<lb/>&amp; with wheat. And this one yellowed &amp;
<lb/>rendered greenish the blue color of paintings. This one is made like the
<lb/>other one except that one puts coarse common turpentine
</ab></div>
<div facs="#f008"><ab>
<lb/>        
<lb/>    
<lb/>But it is used to heighten colors which have soaked in and to keep them
<lb/>from dust. Mastic varnish does not resist rain,
<lb/>whereas that of oil and rosin does.
