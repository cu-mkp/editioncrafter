<lb />One needs to first make the branches of wood or take a
<lb />bizarre thorn branch, then melt a lb of the most
<lb />beautiful clear pitch resin and put in one ounce of
<lb />subtly ground vermilion with walnut oil, and if
<lb />you add in a little Venice laque platte, the
<lb />color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the resin melted
<lb />over a charcoal fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. 
<lb />Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments
<lb />should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the
<lb />charcoal.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Colophony is nothing other than recooked resin. To do
<lb />it well, take a leaded pot &amp; melt the resin,
<lb />&amp; boil it over the brazier a good hour,
<lb />&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like
<lb />water, &amp; easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a
<lb />stick with which you grind it, &amp; test it. Then pour it
<lb />through a coarse canvas or a very light tammy
<lb />cloth, such that when pouring it falls into the
<lb />strongest vinegar that you can find, for the vinegar gives
<lb />it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
<lb />or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For
<lb />counterfeiting your coral, you can mix a quarter part of
<lb />mastic into your purified resin to render it more firm
<lb />and more beautiful, &amp; if you were to take a single tear of
<lb />mastic, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Sulfur &amp; vermilion makes the same effect.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />The coral made of gules red enamel endures the
<lb />file and polishing.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />It is made like cement that is stronger mixed with pestled
<lb />&lt;-than of-&gt; glass rather than with brick. Thus, here one
<lb />mixes well pestled gules red enamel, which
<lb />is red in body, with the vermilion. Thus with all colors of
<lb />enamels.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish for panels
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take a lb of Venice turpentine &amp; heat
<lb />it in a pot until it simmers, and put in half a lb of
<lb />the turpentine oil of the whitest you can find, and stir it
<lb />together well on a charcoal fire and take it off immediately. And
<lb />&lt;-elle-&gt; it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
<lb />add in a little more oil. Similarly if it is too clear, you can
<lb />thicken it by putting in a little turpentine. Thus you will give it
<lb />whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
<lb />heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
<lb />and other painted things without corrupting the colors or yellowing. And
<lb />it dries both in the shade and in the sun, and
<lb />overnight, and during the winter as well as
<lb />in the summer. It is commonly sold 15 sous a
<lb />lb.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />A little more turpentine than turpentine oil is needed in
<lb />order to give body to the varnish, which needs to be applied with
<lb />the finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
<lb />for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
<lb />varnish to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
<lb />of them.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Thick varnish for planks
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />There is a varnish that takes a long time to dry &amp;
<lb />drips more than two months after it has been applied to the
<lb />planks. But this one does not drip like that of times
<lb />past, which was made of linseed oil, garlic boiled in it
<lb />to extinguish it &amp; rid it of grease, 
<lb />&amp; with wheat. And this one yellowed &amp;
<lb />rendered greenish the blue color of paintings. This one is made like the
<lb />other one except that one puts coarse common turpentine
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />        
<lb />    
<lb />But it is used to heighten colors which have soaked in and to keep them
<lb />from dust. Mastic varnish does not resist rain,
<lb />whereas that of oil and rosin does.

<lb />instead of fine turpentine. And you can put into two
<lb />lb of &lt;-tou-&gt; common turpentine one lb
<lb />of fine turpentine oil &amp; do everything as with the other one. This one
<lb />will cost you no more than five or six sous per
<lb />lb &amp; is sold for 40 sous per
<lb />lb.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />This vessel is for making large quantities of
<lb />turpentine oil, that is to say a bucket an
<lb />hour, and no matter which turpentine it may be,
<lb />whether fine or crude. One needs to give, as you know, a little
<lb />fire at the beginning and always keep cold water in the cooler
<lb />on the top. The lb is sold at xii sous, &amp;
<lb />at the bottom of the vessel remains the colophony, or
<lb />pix græca. In this vessel, eau-de-vie is also made well,
<lb />and there is no need to distill it again. You
<lb />do not need a oven for this copper vessel, but
<lb />only charcoal around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
<lb />round, you will place it on a trivet.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> It is better to heat the varnish a little bit, rather than to
<lb />put it out in the sun, because this makes the panel
<lb />warp.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> Some say it is not good to distil in this copper
<lb />vessel because it makes things green. However, when tinned, it is
<lb />good.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For varnishing
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Turpentine varnish does not need any glue because it
<lb />is fatty &amp; viscous &amp; it is not absorbed in the wood like that
<lb />of spike lavender &amp; sandarac. Also, that of spike
<lb />lavender does not require any glue on iron &amp;
<lb />similar things that do not absorb. But on wood &amp; on colors
<lb />which &lt;-have-&gt; do not have gum or 
<lb />distemper glue, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<lb />hide glue &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
<lb />varnish.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />
</ab>

<pb facs="#f010" />

<lb />
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish of spike lavender oil
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />One needs to heat spike lavender oil &amp; as it begins to
<lb />simmer, put in powdered sandarac gum so that it soon melts. And
<lb />over a charcoal fire stir continuously until the sandarac
<lb />is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<lb />varnish on a plate, and if it is fatty when you handle
<lb />it with a finger, it is ready. And for one lb
<lb />of spike lavender oil, you will put five ounces of
<lb />pulverized sandarac, although some only put in four
<lb />ounces, but this is neither so good nor so fatty. This one is
<lb />promptly dry. Frame makers, to avoid the trouble of polishing
<lb />their ebony, varnish it with this, as do guitar makers.
<lb />This is not as appropriate for panels as that of fine turpentine,
<lb />though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not use to
<lb />varnish the landscape of a panel when linseed varnish was in use,
<lb />because it yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<lb />turpentine, one varnishes everywhere. You can put in
<lb />pulverized mastic extracted in tears or otherwise, &amp; it will be
<lb />more desiccative, in place of sandarac.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If you want to varnish on plaster or a wall, first put on
<lb />your very hot hide glue, because if were cold it
<lb />would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your
<lb />varnish on, it would come off.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish of spike lavender oil is not as appropriate for colors as
<lb />that of turpentine, for spike lavender oil &lt;-makes them
<lb />die-&gt; eats the colors since it is too
<lb />penetrating.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For removing varnish from an old panel that is yellowish &amp;
<lb />varnishing it anew
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take white soap &amp; sieved ashes&lt;-e-&gt;, &amp;
<lb />soak both in water. And with a sponge, take the said
<lb />ashes &amp; soap &amp; rub the panel with them. And as you
<lb />see that the old varnish is removed, throw a
<lb />bucket of water against the panel to clean it.
<lb />Next put it for a quarter of an hour in the
<lb />sun to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
<lb />is dry, you can spread your turpentine varnish on it.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Make sure the colors do not come off.

<lb />Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks,

</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take linseed oil or more cheaply, walnut
<lb />oil, and rid it of grease with garlic &amp;
<lb />&lt;-onions-&gt; +hog’s
<lb />fennel, some also add bread crusts, which you will
<lb />boil in it for a good quarter of an hour. Next, put
<lb />in one lb of the oil thus boiled the size of a walnut of black
<lb />pitch &amp; a double handful of grains of wheat, without
<lb />removing the garlic &amp; onions, and let
<lb />it boil together for a good quarter of an hour. And
<lb />when the pitch is well melted &amp; when the oil has body,
<lb />you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
<lb />iron over a low charcoal fire &amp; apply your
<lb />varnish with a feather or a brush.
<lb />And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
<lb />varnish is dry.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />For excellent black varnish, add two or three paternoster
<lb />beads of jet among the rest.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Some consider walnut oil better.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />If there is a lot of varnish, it needs to boil for at least
<lb />half a day, for it is better the more it boils. It
<lb />is dangerous if it catches fire, if it goes over the top, and is
<lb />hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a courtyard or an
<lb />open space.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb /> 
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />In five or six lb of oil, one must put one lb
<lb />of galipot, which costs 4 sous, &amp; some
<lb />peeled garlic cloves. This varnish in and of
<lb />itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.

<lb />as soon.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Varnish of iron engravers
</ab>
<ab>
<lb />Take linseed oil or walnut oil
<lb />&amp;, in place of black pitch, you will put in a little
<lb />pitch resin, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the fashion of black
<lb />varnish on fire. And for applying it, heat your iron &amp;
<lb />give it only one layer of varnish, &amp; when it no longer
<lb />smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a steel point
<lb />whatever you want. Next take salt &amp;
<lb />verdigris &amp; mix as much of one as of the other in quite
<lb />strong vinegar &amp; leave it for xx4 hours
<lb />before using it, &amp; all will be tempered. Next spread some of this
<lb />liquor or sauce on the engraved object with a sponge
