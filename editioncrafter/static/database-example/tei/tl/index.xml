				<p>One needs to first make the branches of <seg ana="#rs-m">wood</seg> or take a bizarre <seg ana="#rs-m">thorn branch</seg>, then melt a <seg ana="#rs-ms">lb</seg> of the most beautiful <seg ana="#rs-m">clear pitch resin</seg> and put in one <seg ana="#rs-ms">ounce</seg> of <seg ana="#rs-m">subtly ground vermilion</seg> with <seg ana="#rs-pa">walnut</seg> oil, and if you add in a little <seg ana="#rs-pl">Venice</seg> <seg ana="#rs-fr">laque platte</seg>, the color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the <seg ana="#rs-m">resin</seg> melted over a <seg ana="#rs-m">charcoal</seg> fire and not of flame, for fear that it catches fire. Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if any filaments should remain on it, turn the branch over the heat of the <seg ana="#rs-m">charcoal</seg>.</p>
				<p rend="left-top" style="tall"><seg ana="#rs-m">Colophony</seg> is nothing other than recooked <seg ana="#rs-m">resin</seg>. To do it well, take a <seg ana="#rs-m">leaded</seg> pot &amp; melt the <seg ana="#rs-m">resin</seg>, &amp; boil it over the <seg ana="#rs-tl">brazier</seg> a good <seg ana="#rs-tmp">hour</seg>, &amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like <seg ana="#rs-m">water</seg>, &amp; easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a <seg ana="#rs-tl">stick</seg> with which you grind it, &amp; test it. Then pour it through a <seg ana="#rs-m">coarse canvas</seg> or a <seg ana="#rs-m">very light tammy cloth</seg>, such that when pouring it falls into the strongest <seg ana="#rs-m">vinegar</seg> that you can find, for the <seg ana="#rs-m">vinegar</seg> gives it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For counterfeiting your <seg ana="#rs-m">coral</seg>, you can mix a <seg ana="#rs-ms">quarter part</seg> of <seg ana="#rs-m">mastic</seg> into your <seg ana="#rs-m">purified resin</seg> to render it more firm and more beautiful, &amp; if you were to take a single tear of <seg ana="#rs-m">mastic</seg>, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.</p>
				<p rend="left-top"><seg ana="#rs-m">Sulfur</seg> &amp; <seg ana="#rs-m">vermilion</seg> makes the same effect.</p>
				<p rend="top">The <seg ana="#rs-m">coral</seg> made of <seg ana="#rs-m">gules red enamel</seg> endures the <seg ana="#rs-tl">file</seg> and polishing.</p>
				<p rend="right-top">It is made like <seg ana="#rs-m">cement</seg> that is stronger mixed with <seg ana="#rs-tl">pestled</seg> <del>than of</del> glass rather than with <seg ana="#rs-m">brick</seg>. Thus, here one mixes well <seg ana="#rs-tl">pestled</seg> <seg ana="#rs-m">gules red enamel</seg>, which is red in body, with the <seg ana="#rs-m">vermilion</seg>. Thus with all colors of <seg ana="#rs-m">enamels</seg>.</p>

				<p>Take a <seg ana="#rs-ms">lb</seg> of <seg ana="#rs-pl">Venice</seg> turpentine &amp; heat it in a <seg ana="#rs-tl">pot</seg> until it simmers, and put in half a <seg ana="#rs-ms">lb</seg> of the <seg ana="#rs-m">turpentine oil</seg> of the whitest you can find, and stir it together well on a <seg ana="#rs-m">charcoal</seg> fire and take it off immediately. And <del><seg ana="#rs-fr">elle</seg></del> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you, add in a little more <seg ana="#rs-m">oil</seg>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting in a little <seg ana="#rs-m">turpentine</seg>. Thus you will give it whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things without corrupting the colors or yellowing. And it dries both <seg ana="#rs-env">in the shade</seg> and <seg ana="#rs-env">in the sun</seg>, and <seg ana="#rs-tmp">overnight</seg>, and <seg ana="#rs-tmp">during the winter</seg> as well as <seg ana="#rs-tmp">in the summer</seg>.

				<p rend="left-bottom" style="tall">A little more <seg ana="#rs-m">turpentine</seg> than <seg ana="#rs-m">turpentine oil</seg> is needed in order to give body to the <seg ana="#rs-m">varnish</seg>, which needs to be applied with the <seg ana="#rs-bp">finger</seg> in order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks.
